    <h1>Pre-Internet Era</h1>

    <h2>J.C.R. Licklider</h2>
    <p>J.C.R. Licklider, a computer scientist and psychologist, envisioned a global network of computers, which he called the "Intergalactic Computer Network." His goal was to enable people to communicate and collaborate over long distances in a seamless way, far beyond the limitations of existing systems. Licklider’s revolutionary ideas influenced the development of modern computing and laid the foundation for a more interconnected world. In the early 1960s, his work at ARPA laid the groundwork for ARPANET, a precursor to the internet, marking the beginning of the shift toward a digital future.</p>

    <h2>Nuclear Weapons and Communication</h2>
    <p>The threat of nuclear war during the Cold War drove governments and defense agencies to seek secure, decentralized communication systems that could withstand potential attacks. The fear of widespread destruction made it crucial to create networks that could continue functioning even if parts of the system were damaged. Research funded by ARPA in the 1950s and 1960s led to the development of packet-switching technology, which was essential for the resilience and efficiency of ARPANET. This technology became a cornerstone in ensuring reliable communication across long distances.</p>

    <h2>ARPA (Later DARPA)</h2>
    <p>Founded in 1958 after the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik, ARPA (later DARPA) was created to fund advanced technologies with national defense applications. ARPA's role was to push the boundaries of technology, which eventually extended beyond defense into civilian applications. The agency’s groundbreaking research in packet-switching networks directly contributed to the creation of ARPANET, the first network to use this technology on a wide scale. ARPA's efforts paved the way for the modern internet, transforming how people communicate and share information globally.</p>
