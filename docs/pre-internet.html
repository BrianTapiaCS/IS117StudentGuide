    <h1>Pre-Internet Era</h1>

    <h2>JC Licklider</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Who:</strong> J.C.R. Licklider, a computer scientist and psychologist.</li>
        <li><strong>What:</strong> He envisioned a global network of computers, calling it the "Intergalactic Computer Network".</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> His vision was to allow humans to interact with computers in a way that facilitates communication and collaboration over large distances.</li>
        <li><strong>When:</strong> He proposed this idea in the early 1960s.</li>
        <li><strong>How:</strong> His work at ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) laid the groundwork for ARPANET, the precursor to the internet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nuclear Weapons</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Who:</strong> Governments and defense agencies.</li>
        <li><strong>What:</strong> The potential of nuclear war spurred the need for resilient communication systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> The need for secure, decentralized communication systems to withstand possible attacks during the Cold War.</li>
        <li><strong>When:</strong> This need arose during the height of Cold War tensions in the 1950s and 1960s.</li>
        <li><strong>How:</strong> Research funded by ARPA led to the development of packet-switching technology, which would become critical in ARPANET’s development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ARPA (Later DARPA)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Who:</strong> ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), later renamed DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency).</li>
        <li><strong>What:</strong> ARPA funded critical research that led to the creation of ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet.</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> ARPA was created to fund advanced technologies for national defense purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>When:</strong> ARPA was founded in 1958, following the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union.</li>
        <li><strong>How:</strong> ARPA’s research included the development of packet-switching networks, which would later be used in ARPANET.</li>
    </ul>
