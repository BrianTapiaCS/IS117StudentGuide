            <h2>ARPANET</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> ARPANET was the first network to implement the protocol suite TCP/IP, which became the foundation for the modern internet.</li>
                <li><strong>When:</strong> ARPANET was developed in the late 1960s, with the first successful message sent in 1969.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> The goal was to create a resilient communication network that could survive potential disruptions and ensure data could still be transferred.</li>
                <li><strong>Who:</strong> ARPANET was developed by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. Department of Defense.</li>
                <li><strong>How:</strong> By using packet-switching technology, ARPANET allowed for distributed communication that laid the foundation for the internet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>ARPANET's success demonstrated the power of packet-switching technology and provided the technical framework for what would later become the global internet. It also introduced TCP/IP, the standard protocol suite that is still in use today.</p>

            <h2>TCP/IP and the Global Network</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is a set of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>When:</strong> TCP/IP was adopted as the standard protocol for ARPANET in 1983, marking a crucial step in creating the internet as we know it.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> TCP/IP was designed to enable reliable communication between different networks, making it the standard that enabled the internet to scale globally.</li>
                <li><strong>Who:</strong> Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn are credited with developing TCP/IP, often referred to as the "fathers of the internet".</li>
                <li><strong>How:</strong> TCP/IP provided a common language for computers to communicate, allowing disparate networks to connect and form a larger, more resilient global network.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With the adoption of TCP/IP, networks could easily interconnect, allowing the internet to grow into the massive, interconnected web that we experience today. This protocol suite was fundamental in transforming a military project into a global communication phenomenon.</p>

            <h2>Birth of the World Wide Web</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> The World Wide Web (WWW) is an information system that allows documents to be connected via hyperlinks, accessible through the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>When:</strong> The WWW was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee and became publicly accessible in 1991.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> The purpose was to create a universal and accessible platform where information could be shared globally in a simple and intuitive way.</li>
                <li><strong>Who:</strong> Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, is credited with inventing the World Wide Web while working at CERN.</li>
                <li><strong>How:</strong> By combining hypertext with the TCP/IP protocol, Berners-Lee enabled users to access and navigate linked information on the internet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The World Wide Web transformed the internet from a technical infrastructure used by scientists and academics into a platform accessible to the public. It enabled the sharing of information, communication, and commerce, ultimately changing how society functions.</p>
