    <h1>The Birth of the Internet</h1>

    <h2>ARPANET</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Who:</strong> ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency).</li>
        <li><strong>What:</strong> ARPANET was the first network to implement TCP/IP, the core protocol of the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> It was developed to allow research institutions to communicate over long distances and share data securely.</li>
        <li><strong>When:</strong> ARPANET was created in 1969.</li>
        <li><strong>How:</strong> ARPANET used packet-switching technology to transmit data, and in 1983 it adopted TCP/IP, which allowed for interoperability between networks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Who:</strong> Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, computer scientists known as the “Fathers of the Internet.”</li>
        <li><strong>What:</strong> They developed the TCP/IP protocol, the foundation of data communication on the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> They sought to create a reliable, standardized protocol for networks to communicate with each other.</li>
        <li><strong>When:</strong> TCP/IP was developed in the 1970s and implemented in 1983.</li>
        <li><strong>How:</strong> Their work allowed different types of networks to communicate seamlessly, transforming ARPANET into the global internet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Early ARPANET Programs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Who:</strong> ARPA and early researchers on ARPANET.</li>
        <li><strong>What:</strong> Programs like Gopher and Telnet were used for information retrieval and remote access over ARPANET.</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> These programs were some of the first to make ARPANET practical for academic and research use.</li>
        <li><strong>When:</strong> Early 1970s.</li>
        <li><strong>How:</strong> Gopher was an early search tool, while Telnet allowed users to log into remote systems.</li>
    </ul>
