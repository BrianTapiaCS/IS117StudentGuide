    <h1>The Birth of the Internet</h1>

    <h2>ARPANET</h2>
    <p>ARPANET, developed by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), was the first network to implement TCP/IP, a protocol that forms the backbone of today’s internet. Originally designed to enable research institutions to communicate securely over long distances, ARPANET pioneered packet-switching technology, which revolutionized data transmission by breaking it into smaller packets. Created in 1969, ARPANET was groundbreaking, and in 1983, it adopted TCP/IP, allowing different networks to interact seamlessly, laying the foundation for the modern internet as we know it today.</p>

    <h2>Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn</h2>
    <p>Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, often called the “Fathers of the Internet,” were instrumental in creating the TCP/IP protocol, which became the standard for data communication. Their work in the 1970s addressed the growing need for reliable and consistent communication between different types of networks. By 1983, TCP/IP was fully implemented, allowing for the interoperability of previously incompatible systems. Their contributions were pivotal in transforming ARPANET into the global internet, making worldwide data sharing possible across diverse networks.</p>

    <h2>Early ARPANET Programs</h2>
    <p>In the early 1970s, programs like Gopher and Telnet were developed as some of the first practical applications of ARPANET. Gopher became an early search tool that allowed users to retrieve information, while Telnet provided remote access to other machines on the network, enabling researchers to log into systems across the country. These tools made ARPANET an essential platform for academic and research purposes, marking a significant step toward the internet's practical utility for users in education and beyond.</p>
