    <h1>Web 2.0: Dynamic Web</h1>

    <h2>Google Search & PageRank</h2>
    <p>In 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two Stanford PhD students, founded Google with the goal of making the web more accessible and useful through improved search technology. Central to Google's early success was their invention of the PageRank algorithm, which ranked web pages based on the number and quality of incoming links. Unlike previous search engines that primarily focused on keyword matching, PageRank considered how reputable and relevant a website was by analyzing its backlinks. This innovative approach transformed the quality of search results, making Google the leading search engine on the web and setting the foundation for its dominance in the internet industry.</p>
