            <h2>Static Web Pages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> Web 1.0 consisted primarily of static web pages that displayed content but did not interact significantly with the user.</li>
                <li><strong>When:</strong> Web 1.0 was prevalent from the early 1990s to the early 2000s.</li>
                <li><strong>Why:</strong> The primary focus was on providing information rather than interactivity, and web pages were often created by hand using HTML.</li>
                <li><strong>How:</strong> Static HTML pages were linked together, and users could navigate using hyperlinks without any dynamic interaction or personalization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Web 1.0 represented the first phase of the World Wide Web, where the main focus was to share information. Users were able to consume content but had little to no way to contribute or interact with the site beyond clicking links.</p>

            <h2>Limitations of Web 1.0</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limited Interaction:</strong> The content was static, meaning users could read but not contribute or interact.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Creators:</strong> Only webmasters or individuals with HTML knowledge could create or update web content.</li>
                <li><strong>No Personalization:</strong> There was no way to personalize content for individual users or collect user data for improved services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Web 1.0 was largely read-only, which limited user engagement. It lacked the dynamic, user-generated content that characterizes later versions of the web.</p>

            <h2>Technologies Behind Web 1.0</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML:</strong> HyperText Markup Language (HTML) was the primary language used to create static web pages.</li>
                <li><strong>HTTP:</strong> HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) was used to request and transmit web pages over the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>Browsers:</strong> Early web browsers like Mosaic and Netscape Navigator were used to navigate the World Wide Web.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Web 1.0 was built on a simple set of technologies designed to share static information. HTML provided the structure, HTTP allowed communication, and early browsers made the web accessible to the public.</p>
