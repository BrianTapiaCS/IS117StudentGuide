    <h1>Web 1.0: The Early Web</h1>

    <h2>Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
    <p>Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, is credited with inventing the World Wide Web, a system that revolutionized how information is shared online. He developed both HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), which became the foundational technologies of the web. His vision was to create a universal platform for linking and sharing documents, making the internet accessible to everyone. In 1989, while working at CERN, Berners-Lee introduced HTML to create web pages and HTTP to enable their transmission, creating the first framework for web browsing and information sharing.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript, developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape, brought a new level of interactivity to the web. Before its creation, web pages were largely static, but JavaScript allowed for dynamic behavior, enabling user interactions without needing to reload the entire page. JavaScript quickly became the standard for client-side scripting, transforming the web into a more engaging, responsive platform. Today, it remains one of the most widely used programming languages for creating interactive websites and web applications.</p>
